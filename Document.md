# A hypercube inspired blockchain architecture
"Some things that are invisible and untouchable 
can nevertheless be seen and felt‚Äù
Michael Chabon, Summerland

## What is a blockchain
Well, blockchain is much more than just cryptocurrencies. The system is like a giant computer that is a huge cluster of many small independent nodes that perform calculations. This very thing makes it decentralized, which also means that this network never goes down. You can run operations on this network, for which you have to pay a minimal amount of money as a processing fee, which basically is the gas fee of a network which is mostly used to reward the miners which are nodes on this network. It's actually a story that's a little long, but what we need to focus on is mainly the way the data is stored on this network, and how implementing a hypercube format will affect it's working. 

 
## Data storage on the blockchain
Currently on most famous networks like Ethereum and Bitcoin, data is stored in the form of a linear chain of blocks. Where each block is connected to the previous block through a hash value.

 This is one of the ways the network keeps an immutable and a valid record of stuff.  However, what would happen if this structure was to  gain more dimensions, what if each block was connected to five different blocks like in  a hypercube structure. Before we dive deeper into this let's look at the anatomy of a blockchain.
